Deep Learning Class at Purdue (Prof Kak and Prof Bouman)

Code mostly in PyTorch for various class projects.

Projects usually involve writing custom dataloaders to parallelize grabbing data for input into DNNs. 

Projects are on various DL problems like classification, optimization, single instance and multi instance object detection, and generative networks.
